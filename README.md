# Starmodder 2

A browser for my unofficial Starsector mod database.

Starmodder 1 may be found at <https://starmodder.pages.dev/mods/home/>. It works just fine, and better in some ways.

Starmodder 1 is a basic website that's almost entirely HTML, with a little javascript.

Starmodder 2 is written using Flutter, which compiles to a Javascript website. It loads images dynamically and has better search (it supports acronyms).
